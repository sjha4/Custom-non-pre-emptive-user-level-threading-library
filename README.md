#Thread routines.

##MyThread MyThreadCreate (void(*start_funct)(void *), void *args)
This routine creates a new MyThread. The parameter start_func is the function in which the new thread starts executing. The parameter args is passed to the start function. This routine does not pre-empt the invoking thread. In others words the parent (invoking) thread will continue to run; the child thread will sit in the ready queue.

##void MyThreadYield(void)
Suspends execution of invoking thread and yield to another thread. The invoking thread remains ready to execute—it is not blocked. Thus, if there is no other ready thread, the invoking thread will continue to execute.

##int MyThreadJoin(MyThread thread)
Joins the invoking function with the specified child thread. If the child has already terminated, do not block. Note: A child may have terminated without the parent having joined with it. Returns 0 on success (after any necessary blocking). It returns -1 on failure. Failure occurs if specified thread is not an immediate child of invoking thread.

##void MyThreadJoinAll(void)
Waits until all children have terminated. Returns immediately if there are no active children.

##void MyThreadExit(void)
Terminates the invoking thread. Note: all MyThreads are required to invoke this function. Do not allow functions to “fall out” of the start function.

#Semaphore routines.

##MySemaphore MySemaphoreInit(int initialValue)
Create a semaphore. Set the initial value to initialValue, which must be non-negative. A positive initial value has the same effect as invoking MySemaphoreSignal the same number of times. On error it returns NULL.

##void MySemaphoreSignal(MySemaphore sem)
Signal semaphore sem. The invoking thread is not pre-empted.

##void MySemaphoreWait(MySemaphore sem)
Wait on semaphore sem.

##int MySemaphoreDestroy(MySemaphore sem)
Destroy semaphore sem. Do not destroy semaphore if any threads are blocked on the queue. Return 0 on success, -1 on failure.
Unix process routines.

#Initialize the thread library

##void MyThreadInit (void(*start_funct)(void *), void *args)
This routine is called before any other MyThread call. It is invoked only by the Unix process. It is similar to invoking MyThreadCreate immediately followed by MyThreadJoinAll. The MyThread created is the oldest ancestor of all MyThreads—it is the “main” MyThread. This routine can only be invoked once. It returns when there are no threads available to run (i.e., the thread ready queue is empty.

<b>The Unix process in which the user-level threads run is not a MyThread. Therefore, it will not be placed on the queue of MyThreads. Instead it will create the first MyThread and relinquish the processor to the MyThread engine.
